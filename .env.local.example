# Hostinger SMTP Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual credentials

# SMTP Server Settings
SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# SMTP Authentication
# Use your main admin email account credentials
SMTP_USER=admin@websitesbuild.in
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-admin-password-here

# IMPORTANT SECURITY:
# - NEVER commit .env.local to git (it's already in .gitignore)
# - Only commit this .env.local.example file as a template
# - Replace 'your-admin-password-here' with your actual password in .env.local
# - For Vercel deployment, add these variables in Vercel dashboard settings

# Notes:
# - Authenticate with admin@websitesbuild.in (main account)
# - Other emails (info, forms, support, noreply) work as aliases
# - Emails will appear to come from the aliases but authenticate with admin credentials
# - Contact form emails go to: info@websitesbuild.in
# - Project form emails go to: forms@websitesbuild.in
# - Auto-replies sent from: noreply@websitesbuild.in
# - Future support emails will go to: support@websitesbuild.in
